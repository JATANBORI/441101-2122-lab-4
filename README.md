# Practice Lab 4 â€“ Loops 

In this lab, we will understand the different uses of the three types of loop logic structures, and using counters (incrementing by adding a constant value) within them, which decide when the loop should terminate. We shall also learn that relational and logical operators are used in conditional statements to control the flow of execution of the code, and they evaluate to a Boolean type.

There is an assessment BLOCK (L4.6 and L4.7) included with this Lab, which you should attempt. The BLOCK will form part of your portfolio submission for this module, which is assessed at the end of the trimester. For detail on how to submit your portfolio, see the assignment brief on Canvas.
